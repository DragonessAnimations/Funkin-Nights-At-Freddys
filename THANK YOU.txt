And everyone else who has played this mod on YouTube!

I suffer with acute chronic depression, and I have been in a bad place mentally.
Making this mod has been a release for me, though even at times I wanted to give up on it.
Seeing all these amazing people actually taking interest in my work and liking it this much, it's absolutely amazing.
I am thankful to all of you for this. You're really helping to pull me out of this rut I've been in.
So, to those mentioned, and all the rest of you playing right now, thank you so much, and keep being awesome!
